# Colour-Detection-with-Arduino-Camera-Module-OV7670-using-OpenCV
This project focuses on the development of a color detection system using an Arduino microcontroller and the OV7670 camera module, with image processing performed using  OpenCV. The system captures real-time images, transfers them to a computer via serial communication, and applies color detection algorithms to identify and classify object colors.
